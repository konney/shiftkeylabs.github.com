#Cruise ship challenge design

Oceans technology is expected to play a major role in the global economy for decades to come 

between the research and development being conducted for sustainability purposes, military 

operations, supplements and more. Our project  entitled “cruise ship” aims at/tries to find a 

practical application (outside of the research oriented field) to the wealth of data that is 

produced or collected by OTN. Specifically, we want to show how that data can be used for 

tourism attractions in cruise ships. We came with this statement “ How might we connect sea 

cruise company outside to OTN data for vacation planners ?”
