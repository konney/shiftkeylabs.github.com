# Reflective  block  
My reflection about User experience design. User Experience Design encompasses all aspect of end users interaction with the company and its service and its product. User experience design includes elements such as  Users , needs , uses,( Company purpose vision idea) and features, product(Sketches wireframe prototypes).  There are  two areas in which a good user experience design needs to consider for a 


## Company purpose vision idea
The first requirement for user experience is to meet the  needs of the user. Know their behavior , what do they make them a good ideal use. how are they solving the problem.

## Sketches wireframe prototypes
Next comes features of the products. True user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want, or providing checklist features. In order to achieve high-quality user experience in a company's offerings there must be a seamless merging of the services of multiple disciplines, including engineering, marketing, graphical and industrial design, and interface design
