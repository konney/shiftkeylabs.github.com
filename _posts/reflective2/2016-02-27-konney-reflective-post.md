## reflective on business model canvas:
The Business Canvas project was an unique and interesting experience for me.  
I have never been presented with the opportunity to “dissect” a business down to its parts in such a way that the business canvas
helped walk us through.  
For this project, I worked in a team to tackle the business model of the Cruise ship.  
Initially I thought the business canvas model was going to be a challenge to follow considering I have never used that type of
model before, but surprisingly it ended up helping our team stay organized and collect a wide range of information.   We begun to
collect a good portion of the data needed.
value propositions
customers segments
channels
customers relationships
revenue streams 
key partner
Overall, I had a positive experience working with my team, the Cruise ship and our contact as a team.  As a team, we were able to
analysis the current business model and presented with  recommendations for improvements in the area that gaps were present.
Through the Business Canvas project, we were given the opportunity to step into the mind of a design thinker in business and were
able to use different thinking strategies, tools and models to help better understand the business and what it takes to put
together a successful business.
